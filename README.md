# voice_clone_assistant

Voice clone assistant is just like voice assistant such as google assistant, alexa, siri but the odd is we can customize the voice of assistant. usually all the voice assistant contains only two voices such as male and female but here we can customize the voice of our favourite personality. Here I have given an example of ELON MUSK voice and DONALD TRUMPH voice.

#model used
SV2TTS is a three-stage deep learning framework that allows to create a numerical representation of a voice from a few seconds of audio, and to use it to condition a text-to-speech model trained to generalize to new voices.
